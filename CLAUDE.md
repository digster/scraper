Make sure any changes that would warrant an update to the readme are documented accordingly in the readme file.

Always try and use uv whenever trying to use or run anything related to python/pip.

Always try and add tests for new features whenever possible.

Always run tests after changes, to test integrity.

As this app has a GUI, all the features and functionality should have parity with the gui app as well.

For all the features we make, make sure the mcp tools, http api, command line are updated if required.

Make sure the skill file is updated for any relevant updates.

Always ask before removing or changing any major existing functionality that is out of the scope of the request before working on it.
